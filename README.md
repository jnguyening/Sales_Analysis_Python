# Python Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of 12 months of electronics store sales data to uncover actionable business insights. Using Python and the Pandas library, the analysis traverses the entire data lifecycle—from raw, fragmented CSV files to high-level visualizations that answer critical business questions regarding revenue performance, geographic distribution, and consumer behavior.

The core of the project involves sophisticated data wrangling and feature engineering to transform unstructured string data into structured formats suitable for analysis. By extracting temporal and regional variables, the project identifies not only what is selling, but when and where demand is highest, providing a roadmap for optimized marketing spend and inventory management.
